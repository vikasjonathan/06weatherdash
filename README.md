# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this weather dashboard application is to allow travelers to easily check the weather in several cities so they can plan accordingly. The application consists of a heading with the webpage title, a search form where users can input the zip code and country of the city they are searching for, and a clickable search history where buttons are generated after each search. There are two weather sections: one that shows the current weather in the city and one that shows a five day forecast for the city.

## Installation

## Usage

To use this weather dashboard, enter the zip code and two letter country code for the city you would like to search. When you click the submit button, the current weather and a five day forecast for the city you've searched will populate below. The city you searched will be added to your search history. To check the weather for a city you have previously searched, click the button with the city's name in the search history.
